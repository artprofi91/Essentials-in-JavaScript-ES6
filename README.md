# Essentials-in-JavaScript-ES6

ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. Languages like JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript are governed by this specification. I created this repo for the better understanding of the ES6 implementation in JavaScript.

## 1-3 Variables and scoping

ES6 provides two new ways of declaring variables: let and const, which mostly replace the ES5 way of declaring variables, var.

**let**
let works similarly to var, but the variable it declares is block-scoped, it only exists within the current block. var is function-scoped.

In the following code, you can see that the let-declared variable tmp only exists inside the block that starts in line A:

```
function order(x, y) {
    if (x > y) { // (A)
        let tmp = x;
        x = y;
        y = tmp;
    }
    console.log(tmp===x); // ReferenceError: tmp is not defined
    return [x, y];
}
```

**const**
const works like let, but the variable you declare must be immediately initialized, with a value that canâ€™t be changed afterwards.
```
const foo;
    // SyntaxError: missing = in const declaration

const bar = 123;
bar = 456;
    // TypeError: `bar` is read-only
```
Since for-of creates one binding (storage space for a variable) per loop iteration, it is OK to const-declare the loop variable:
```
for (const x of ['a', 'b']) {
    console.log(x);
}
// Output:
// a
// b
```
